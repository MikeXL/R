Long story short, R was created for teaching statistics, only gaining popularity recently with the booming of data analytics and machine learning. Besides statistics, people do crazy stuff with it

1. munging data, it supports sucking in data from all sources - web, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, ODBC
2. presentation & documentation, knitr, rmarkdown mostly shout out by RStudio makers
3. visualization, ggplot2, ggvis

These are all part of the reproducible research movement
