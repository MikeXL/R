t.test
=================

It can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other.  

A t-test is actually a very simple linear model and so we use a simple formula to specify it such as 
    t.test(log(Count)~Species)

null hypothesis H0 refers to a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena.

p-value of 0.10 0.05 0.01 of less than to reject H0 or accept when above. What is this p-value about? remember the normal distribution of the bell curve, that p-value is the determination point of likely or unlikely.. when it so tiny little, it falls on the tail.
